# Kenzie Katas

This repository is a collection of exercises to help keep the minds of
apprentices at [Kenzie Academy](https://kenzie.academy) sharp.


Each set of exercises comes with a README.md that motivates the exercises, as
well as a set of unit tests that can be run using yarn.

Katas revolving around the tree data structure. At the moment, we currently
focus on [rose trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree).
