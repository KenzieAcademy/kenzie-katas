# Kenzie Katas

This repository is a collection of exercises to help keep the minds of
apprentices at [Kenzie Academy](https://kenzie.academy) sharp.


Each set of exercises comes with a README.md that motivates the exercises, as
well as a set of unit tests that can be run using yarn.

## FAQ
Q. I try to run tests, but get errors about files not existing. Are they broken?
A. This is intentional. Some tests will fail because certain features haven't been implemented
   or files haven't been created. While I could have made starter files ahead of time, I wanted
   apprentices to get used to diagnosing error messages

Q. Do I have to use ES6?
A. No. You can use which ever language standard you like. In fact, you can even write your
   solutions in a language that compiles down to ES5 if you like (TypeScript, ClosureScript, PureScript, etc).

## Trees
Katas revolving around the tree data structure. At the moment, we currently
focus on [rose trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree).
